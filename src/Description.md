A Dark Room Description:
The world begins with the player being taught the basic necessities such as getting wood, building simple tools, and lighting fires. You continue to get more options and more abilities to do things as you meet other people (aka builder) and collect more resources. After you collect enough resources, you unlock the path which allows you to move around using WASD keys and ▲◄▼► keys. 
Clear villages in map to gain access to farther travel (possibly reading chapters in the book in order to gain knowledge)
Clear mines to gain access to new resources (finish the test for each chapter in order to unlock new skills)
Adventure / clear dungeon / labyrinth to acquire hint for pop quizzes (like fragment of codes for final exam-ish)


A Blue Screen Brain Storm
Using a random number generator for the random events that go around
Creating items that add / subtract themselves accordingly goes along with APCS and OOP
After you have collected enough built-in’s and if then else for loops while loops
Ability to save place as encrypted data.
create a map (randomly) 
toString() to create a grid
write a basic storyline of events
you are a shut in?
on a computer?
you get a textbook?
it gives you a account?
you’re losing energy?
your sister says she can help?
she brings coffee?
timer goes up you can stay awake for a little bit?
textbook teaches you about fundamentals?
you make money?
you need to go out to spend it but you can’t move without food?
pay sister to bring you food?
you try to leave but pass out from hunger your back in your room?
make more money online?
make it to a caff?
food coffee coffee maker?
now you can move getting education gets you a multiplier for money?
you can now make your own coffee?
you walk into a teacher they sit you down and you have to get a method to work?


Questions/Ideas/Concerns:
Are we going with an apcs theme for this game?
if we are using the CS class story monsters would be homework and tests based on level
health could be a time limit and items or abilities could slow or add time?
Are / How are we going to make this different from the original?
W/ APCS theme
How does one win the game?

Nouns:
resources
Coffee →  recharge your health while on path, can be traded
Special Item: Open Lid Coffee >> same function as coffee, but restore twice as more health. Also, if you give it to teacher, you can skip one of your tests
textbook: receive one at the beginning of the game, that’s how you put in you USERNAME for that one game
Grade (a stat) → you want this to be high as it can… when you end the game, this is your score
Knowledge (a stat) 
Stress (a stat) → health
books → these help you beat tests, you can trade them for other things
pencils → strictly for trade → numbers increase with time
paper → strictly for trade → numbers increase with time
candy → buy this with other items → is like a hut; it attracts people (little siblings?) to help gather items
Computer upgrades - adds bonuses to the amount of points you increase your knowledge statistic by when you increase that statistic
places
school (battle tests)
tests → increase stress (either die of stress or succeed in battle)
have enough books = beat test
beat test = better grade
a block of classrooms that need to be cleared?
do we want to have halls or open campus? where challenges are specific?
friend’s houses (= safe houses)
get coffee to recharge health
coffee shop (have enough money = trade for coffee)
otherwise no effect
street/outdoors
How will we handle empty space?
will there be challenges here too?
grid (displayed with toString)

Verbs:
walk = traverse map
trade = trade pencils for various things: books, coffee, paper

school supplies drive

gives you coffee
available every 30 sec
gives a randomly generated number of supplies between __ and __
Sell code → obtain pencils  
available every __ sec  ~should be automatic as well like wood where it is collected by having more and more code?
gives a randomly generated amount of pencils between __ and __
Work → increases pencils but also stress
available every __ sec
gives a randomly generated amount of pencils between __ and __
increases a randomly generated number of “stress” between __ and __
That thing where the villagers gather things for you

Time: Increment dates, starting from beginning of the year and end at the end of the year
Starting Scenario == 2 settings, A Classroom (An Uncomfortably Cold Classroom) & A Bedroom (Desk)
